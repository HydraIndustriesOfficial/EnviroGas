# EnviroGas

EnviroGas is an interactive app and database that is being developed to visualize CO2 and methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. The project aims to promote decarbonization initiatives, raise awareness, drive transparency, and inspire positive change within the industry.

## Project Description

EnviroGas will offer comprehensive data visualization of emissions from various sources, including flare booms, oil and gas operations, transportation, and refining. It will feature interactive charts, graphs, and maps for better insights into emissions patterns, hotspots, and trends across different sectors, companies, and regions. Users will be able to use comparative analysis tools to benchmark emissions performance and identify areas for improvement.

The project will also highlight best practices and success stories to inspire companies within the oil and gas industry to take proactive steps toward decarbonization. The impact assessment feature will illustrate equivalent emissions in terms of global warming potential, air quality deterioration, and climate change impact. Moreover, users will have access to educational resources, including articles, videos, and infographics, to help them understand the complexities and challenges of transitioning to a low-carbon future. The app will also provide industry news, reports, and policy changes related to decarbonization efforts within the oil and gas sector.

The project is currently a work in progress and welcomes contributions from the community to refine and enhance its features.
